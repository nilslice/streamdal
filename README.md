This is the _main_ repo for the [Streamdal](https://streamdal.com) project.

Streamdal is a combination of open source services and SDKs that enable _real-time_:

* Data observability (think `tail -f` for your data!)
* Data governance & enforcement
* Data quality monitoring
* Data transformation + obfuscation + masking + stripping

.. and [a bunch of other things](https://docs.streamdal.com/capabilities).

# Demo

You don't have to install the [server](https://github.com/streamdal/server), 
the [console](https://github.com/streamdal/console)
or [instrument](https://docs.streamdal.com/instrument) any of your apps to see 
Streamdal in action. We've got a live demo :)

**[DEMO.STREAMDAL.COM](https://demo.streamdal.com)**

In the live demo, you can:

1. Select any component and start a `Tail` to see the data it is consuming or
producing in _real-time_
2. Create pipelines that detect, transform, obfuscate, mask, strip or validate data
3. Attach and detach pipelines to components
4. Watch read/write throughput of components

**Each one of these actions is occurring in _real-time_!**

You can read more about how this is achieved [here](https://docs.streamdal.com/arch).

# Getting Started

Getting started consists of two steps:

1. **Installing** the server, console and their dependencies
2. **Instrumenting** your code with one of our [SDKs](https://docs.streamdal.com/sdks)

### [STEP 1] Install

The _easiest_ way to get Streamdal running is via `curl | bash`:

```
curl -s https://sh.streamdal.com | bash
```

ðŸŽ‰ **Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser and you should see the console!** ðŸŽ‰

> [!NOTE]
> For alternative installation methods, check the [install](./install) dir.

### [STEP 2] Instrument

Once you've installed the server and console, you can instrument your code using
one of our [SDKs](#sdks).

**Go**
```go
// When consuming/reading
// <TODO>

// When producing/writing
// <TODO>
```

**Python**
```python
# When consuming/reading
# <TODO>

# When producing/writing
# <TODO>
```

**Node**
```typescript
// When consuming/reading
// <TODO>

// When producing/writing
// <TODO>
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These are _basic_, non-production ready examples.
> 
> For best results, you should read the [docs](https://docs.streamdal.com/sdks) 
> for the SDK you are using.

### SDKs

Several SDKs are available for instrumenting your code:

* [Go](https://github.com/streamdal/go-sdk)
* [Python](https://github.com/streamdal/python-sdk)
* [Node.js](https://github.com/streamdal/node-sdk)

For details on how to use them, refer to the [SDK docs](https://docs.streamdal.com/sdks).

# How Does It Work?

Streamdal consists of **three** main components:

- **[Server](https://github.com/streamdal/server)**
- **[Console](https://github.com/streamdal/console)**
- **[SDKs](https://docs.streamdal.com/sdks)**

The basic flow is that you [install](#getting-started) the server and console and
wrap any reads or writes in your app with our SDK. Once that's done, you will be 
able to see the data your app is reading or writing in the 
[console](https://github.com/streamdal/console) (or use the  
[CLI](https://github.com/streamdal/cli)).

You will also be able to enforce rules on your data (such as _"this should be 
valid JSON"_, _"message should contain a field called `foo`"_, _"strip all email
addresses"_ and so on).
